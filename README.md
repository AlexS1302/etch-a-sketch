# Etch-a-Sketch

## Introduction
Welcome to my Etch-a Sketch project!  

This project allows users to draw on a grid that can be dynamically generated up to a maximum of 100 squares. As you draw, each square becomes more opaque.  
Every time the grid is regenerated, the squares get a random RGB color.

## Features
* Dynamically generate a grid with up to 100 squares.
* Each square gets a random RGB color until the grid is regenerated.
* Colours become more opaque as you draw.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3 (including Flexbox)
* Javascript
